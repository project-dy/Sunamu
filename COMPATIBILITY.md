|GNOME Music|Working|Cover arts are not shown "at first try". Possibly, the `PropertiesChanged` event is not handled well enough.|
|QMMP|Working|Please enable the MPRIS plugin|
|Spotifyd|Working|While the MPRIS2 implementation is kinda okay, they still need to raise the appropriate D-Bus `PropertiesChanged` event. See [their issue tracker](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/issues/457).|
|Spotify-Qt|Working|The developer has an issue ticket detailing some of the caveats [here](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt/issues/4).
|MPV|Working|With the [mpv-mpris](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris) plugin|
|ShairPortSync|Working|Works with command `shairport-sync -g -v`
|Plasma Browser Integration|Working|It all depends on the website, really|
|Lollypop|Detected|It doesn't implement the `PropertiesChanged` signal|
|Amarok|Detected|Seems to not report the song information; Reported by @KorbsStudio|
|Amberol|Detected|Non-compliant MPRIS2 implementation. Sunamu cannot support players not reporting `mpris:trackId`|
